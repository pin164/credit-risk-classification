# credit-risk-classification
**brief description of the project**:To use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.<br>
**summary of approach:**<br>
>1.Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets<br>
2.Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data<br>
3.Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report<br>

**location within repository**<br>
>data file : Credit_Risk/Resources/lending_data.csv<br>
code to assess the model:Jupyter Notebook :Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classificationV1.ipymb<br>
original template to assess model: Jupyter Notebook :Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipymb<br>

**Code source**:Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classificationV1.ipymb<br>

**Instructions for running the code**:jupyter notebook.  No special instructions to run the code <br>

**dependencies** The python code relies on the data file in the Resources folder<br>
