# credit-risk-classification
**brief description of the project**:To use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.<br>
**summary of approach:**<br>
>1.Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets<br>
2.Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data<br>
3.Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report<br>
